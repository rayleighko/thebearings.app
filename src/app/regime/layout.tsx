/**
 * Bearings — /regime EN landing metadata (USD validation funnel).
 *
 * Standalone brand surface layered on the existing app. `title.absolute`
 * escapes the root "%s · Cohort" template so the document title is pure
 * Bearings. OG/Twitter values are the exact strings from the launch brief;
 * absolute www.thebearings.app URLs are used so the share card resolves to the
 * production domain regardless of the (preview) host that renders it.
 *
 * Canonical host is www: the apex (thebearings.app) 308-redirects to www at the
 * Vercel domain layer, so canonical/og:url/twitter all point at www to match
 * what is actually served (no apex↔www canonical split).
 *
 * The share card is the "Same kind of crash / opposite outcome" 2008-vs-2022
 * contrast card (1200×630, the 1.91:1 OG standard) — a stronger hook than the
 * regime matrix, and free of the in-matrix data dots removed from the body.
 *
 * The route is brand-isolated: the global Cohort KR Footer is suppressed for
 * /regime (see ConditionalFooter), and the page sets <html lang="en"> at runtime.
